# Test Logic

A file to help me test logical equations for equivalences and such.

This was originally a one-off script that I made to help me with my
homework for a class once, but I keep needing to resurrect it for
random one-off stuff every few months or so, and I keep forgetting
where the latest version lives, so I might as well version-control it.
